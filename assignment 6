1.Which command is used to list the contents of a directory? Justify with proper example.
- ls command
- Examples : 
paul@debian8:~$ ls
allfiles.txt dmesg.txt services stuff summer.txt
2.Write the command to create a new directory named 123test_dir. 
- mkdir 123test_dir
3. What is the purpose of the sed command? Justify with proper example.
- sed command: Stream editor for filtering and transforming text
-Example:
#Replace text
paul@debian5:~/pipes$ echo level5 | sed 's/5/42/' level42
paul@debian5:~/pipes$ echo level5 | sed 's/level/jump/' jump5
4. Which distinct command is used to display one-line descriptions of any commands? 
- whatis command
5.Write the command to create an empty file named “notes.txt”.
- touch notes.txt
6. Differentiate between grep and awk commands with an example.
grep:
•	Global Regular Expression Print.
•	Primarily for looking up text which matches a pattern.
•	Simply prints the lines with the pattern.
Example: 
paul@RHEL4b pipes]$ cat tennis.txt
Amelie Mauresmo, Fra
Kim Clijsters, BEL
Justine Henin, Bel
Serena Williams, usa
Venus Williams, USA
# Basic search
 paul@RHEL4b pipes]$ grep Williams tennis.txt Serena 
Williams, usa 
Venus Williams, USA
awk:
•	A language for scanning and processing patterns.
•	Can search like grep, but also manipulate text, extract fields, and take actions/calculations.
•	Far more powerful for structured data such as CSV or logs.
Example: CSV file employees.csv:
John,Developer,5000
Jane,Manager,7000
Bob,Developer,5500
Alice,Designer,4500
To calculate average salary by department:
awk -F',' '{dept[$2]+=$3; count[$2]++} END {for (d in dept) print d, dept[d]/count[d]}' employees.csv
7. Write the command to give read, write, and execute permission to the owner of a file script.sh.
-chmod u+rwx script.sh 
Or
 chmod 700 script.sh
8. How is chown different from chgrp? Give one example for each. 
1.	Purpose chown: Is used to change the owner of a file or directory. 
            Syntax: chown new_owner filename 
            Example: sudo chown manasa report.txt
      2.   chgrp: Will only change the group ownership of a file or directory. 
             Syntax: chgrp new_group filename
              Example: sudo chgrp students report.txt
9. A user complains that they cannot execute a file even though it exists in their directory. How would you troubleshoot this using ls -l, chmod, and whoami?
- Step 1: Check current user
whoami
Step 2: Check file permissions 
ls -l filename
Output displays permissions in format: -rwxr-xr--
•	Position 1: File type
•	Positions 2-4: User owner permissions (rwx)
•	Positions 5-7: Group owner permissions (r-x)
•	Positions 8-10: Others permissions (r--)
Step 3: Add execute permission (Page 313)
chmod u+x filename
# OR
chmod +x filename
 Full Troubleshooting Process:
# 1. Self-identification
paul@debian8:~$ whoami
paul
# 2. Permissions check on file
paul@debian8:~$ ls -l script.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1 paul paul 0 Oct 15 10:30 script.sh
# Observe: no 'x' (execute) permission for anyone
# 3. Execute permission added for user owner
paul@debian8:~$ chmod u+x script.sh
# 4. Change confirmed
paul@debian8:~$ ls -l script.sh
-rwxr--r-- 1 paul paul 0 Oct 15 10:30 script.sh
# Now includes 'x' for user owner
# 5. File execution
paul@debian8:~$ ./script.sh
"You have to explicitly do a chmod +x to make a file executable."
10. Design a command pipeline to: find all .log files modified in the last 2 days in/var/log, display them on screen, and save the results into a file recent_logs.txt using tee command.
- Commands involved:
•	find 
•	tee 
find command 
# Find files newer than a reference
find. -newer file42.txt
# Find files of specific type
find. -type f -name "*.conf"
tee command 
"The tee filter puts stdin on stdout and also into a file."
[paul@RHEL4b pipes]$ tac count.txt | tee temp.txt | tac
Content of count.txt appears here
one

five
**Solution for the given problem:**
```bash
find /var/log -name "*.log" -type f -mtime -2 | tee recent_logs.txt
Explanation:
•	find /var/log: Search in /var/log directory
•	-name "*.log": Find files ending with .log
•	-type f: Only regular files 
•	-mtime -2: Modified in last 2 days
•	| tee recent_logs.txt: Display on screen AND save to file
