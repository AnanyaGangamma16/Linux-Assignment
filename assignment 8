11. What is a user-defined function in shell scripting? Explain with an example. (CO4)
A: User-Defined Function in Shell ScriptingA user-defined function is a collection of commands under a name.You can use the function anywhere in the script.
It organizes code and prevents repetition.
Syntax
function_name() {
    # commands
}
Example
#!/bin/bash
# This script exhibits a user-defined function
# Define a function
greet() {
    echo "Hello! Welcome to Bash scripting."
}
# Call the function
greet
Output
Hello! Welcome to Bash scripting.
Explanation
greet() → This is the function name.
The instructions within { } execute when you invoke the function.
greet → This line invokes the function and displays the message.
12. Write a bash script with a function that multiply two integer numbers. (CO4)
A: Script: multiply.sh
#!/bin/bash
# This script multiplies two integers using a function
# Function to multiply two numbers
multiply() {
    result=$(( $1 * $2 ))
    echo "The multiplication of $1 and $2 is: $result"
}
# Read two integers from the user
read -p "Enter the first number: " num1
read -p "Enter the second number: " num2
# Call the function with the two numbers
multiply $num1 $num2
________________________________________
Steps to run:
1.	Save the file as multiply.sh.
2.	Make it executable:
chmod +x multiply.sh
3.	Run the script:
./multiply.sh
________________________________________
Sample Run:
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 4
The multiplication of 5 and 4 is: 20
________________________________________
Explanation:
•	multiply() → Defines a function that multiplies two numbers.
•	$1 and $2 → Represent the first and second arguments passed to the function.
•	$(( $1 * $2 )) → Performs arithmetic multiplication.
•	Function is called with the user input to get the result.
This is a clean and reusable way to multiply numbers in a Bash script.
If you want, I can also make a version that multiplies any number of integers using a loop.
13. Explain how arrays (1D, 2D, and 3D) are declared in bash scripting. (CO4)
A: One-Dimensional (1D) Array
A 1D array is just a list of values.
How to declare:
fruits=("Apple" "Banana" "Orange")
Access elements:
echo ${fruits[0]}   # Apple
echo ${fruits[@]}   # All elements
2. Two-Dimensional (2D) Array
Bash doesn't support real 2D arrays, but we can make them look like they are present with associative arrays.
How to declare:
declare -A matrix
matrix[0,0]=1
matrix[0,1]=2
matrix[1,0]=3
matrix[1,1]=4
Access elements:
echo ${matrix[1,1]}   # 4
3. Three-Dimensional (3D) Array
Bash does not support native 3D arrays, yet we can mimic the use of associative arrays with three indices.
Declaring:
declare -A cube
cube[0,0,0]=10
cube[0,0,1]=20
cube[0,1,0]=30
cube[1,0,0]=40
Accessing elements:
echo ${cube[0,0,1]}   # 20
14. Write a shell script to display elements of an array. (CO4)
A: Script: display_array.sh
#!/bin/bash
# This script shows elements of an array
# Declare an array
fruits=("Apple" "Banana" "Orange" "Mango")
# Show all elements
echo "All fruits: ${fruits[@]}"
# Show elements one by one using a loop
echo "Fruits individually:"
for fruit in "${fruits[@]}"
do
    echo "$fruit"
done
Steps to run:
Save the file as display_array.sh.
Make it executable:
chmod +x display_array.sh
Run the script:
./display_array.sh
Sample Output:
All fruits: Apple Banana Orange Mango
Fruits individually:
Apple
Banana
Orange
Mango
15. What is the purpose of cron in Linux? (CO4)
A: Purpose of cron in Linux
cron is a Linux time-based job scheduler.
It is employed to run commands or scripts automatically at a specified time or interval.
It is helpful in performing tasks such as:
Making backups on a daily basis
Executing system maintenance
Sending automated emails
Updating logs on a regular basis
Important Points:
Executes recurring tasks automatically without human intervention.
Employing cron jobs, which are scheduled commands placed in a file named crontab.
Example of a Cron Job
0 7 * * * /home/user/backup.sh
This executes the script backup.sh daily at 7:00 AM
16. Write a cron job to run a backup script every day at midnight. (CO4)
A: Cron Job
0 0 * * * /home/user/backup.sh
Explanation of the Fields
Field\tMeaning\tValue for this cron job
Minute\tWhen to run (0–59)\t0
Hour\tHour to run (0–23)\t0 (midnight)
Day\tDay of the month (1–31)\t* (every day)
Month\tMonth (1–12)\t* (every month)
Weekday\tDay of the week (0–7)\t* (every day)
Command\tScript to execute\t/home/user/backup.sh
Steps to Add the Cron Job
Open crontab for editing:
crontab -e
Add the line:
0 0 * * * /home/user/backup.sh
Save and exit.
The script /home/user/backup.sh will now execute automatically every day at midnight.
17. How do you schedule a one-time job using at command? (CO4)
A: Scheduling a Single Job with at
The at command is utilized to execute a command once at a particular time.
Steps:
Open at and mention the time:
at 14:30
This will schedule a job at 2:30 PM today.
Mention the command to execute:
/home/user/backup.sh
End the input by pressing Ctrl+D.
Example
at 23:00
at> /home/user/backup.sh
at> <Ctrl+D>
This will execute the backup script once at 11:00 PM.
Check Scheduled Jobs
atq
Delete a Scheduled Job
atrm <job_number>
18. Write a script to display disk usage using df and du. (CO4)
A: Script: disk_usage.sh
#!/bin/bash
# This script prints disk usage using df and du
echo "=== Disk Usage of File Systems (df) ==="
df -h   # Prints disk usage of all file systems in human-readable format
echo
echo "=== Disk Usage of Current Directory (du) ==="
du -sh. # Prints total size of current directory in human-readable format
Steps to run:
Save the file as disk_usage.sh.
Make it executable:
chmod +x disk_usage.sh
Run the script:
./disk_usage.sh
Sample Output:
=== Disk Usage of File Systems (df) ===
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1       50G   20G   28G  42% /
=== Disk Usage of Current Directory (du) ===
2.5G    .
Explanation:
.df -h → Displays disk usage of all mounted file systems in human-readable format (KB, MB, GB).
du -sh. → Displays total size of current directory.
-h → Human-readable format,
-s → Summarizes total size.
19. How can you log the output of a script using the tee command? (CO4)
A: Logging Script Output Using tee
The tee command saves the output of a script on the screen as well as in a file.
Example
#!/bin/bash
# sample_script.sh
echo "This is a test message"
echo "Logging script output"
Run the script and log output using tee:
./sample_script.sh | tee output.log
What Happens:
You see the output on the screen.
The same output is saved in output.log.
Append to a Log File
To append to the log file without overwriting:
./sample_script.sh | tee -a output.log
20. Explain with an example how shell scripting can automate system administration tasks. (CO4)
A: Shell Scripting for System Admin Automation
System admin tasks range from:
Backups of files
 Cleaning temp files
Disk space checks
Monitoring system performance
All these tasks can be automated by shell scripts so that you don't have to repeat them manually each time.Example: Backup Script
#!/bin/bash
# Script for automatic backup of /home/user/data folder
# Create a backup directory with today's date
backup_folder="/home/user/backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)"
mkdir -p "$backup_folder"
# Copy files to the backup directory
cp -r /home/user/data/* "$backup_folder"
echo "Backup done successfully at $(date)"
How it Automates Tasks
No manual labor: You don't have to copy files manually.
Schedules itself: This script can be run automatically every day using cron.
Logs activity: The script outputs a message with date and time.
Sample Run Output
Backup completed successfully at Tue Oct 7 14:45:12 IST 2025
