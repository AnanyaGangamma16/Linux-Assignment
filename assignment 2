1.	What does the command pwd, whoami, and hostname display? (CO1) 
Pwd – print working directory
Prints the present working directory (current folder path).
Example: ananya㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ pwd
/home/ananya
whoami
Prints the current logged-in user’s name.
Example: (ananya㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ whoami
Ananya
Hostname
The hostname command shows or sets the system hostname.
(ananya㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ hostname   
kali
2.	Write the command to create a directory named “project” inside the /home/student folder and keep three .txt file into it. Give output snapshot. (CO1) 
(ananya㉿kali)-[/home]
└─$ cd student
                                                                                
┌──(ananya㉿kali)-[/home/student]
└─$ sudo mkdir project
                                                                                
┌──(ananya㉿kali)-[/home/student]
└─$ cd project
┌──(ananya㉿kali)-[/home/student/project]
└─$ sudo touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
                                                                                
┌──(ananya㉿kali)-[/home/student/project]
└─$ ls
file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt
 
3. Explain the difference between absolute path and relative path with proper examples. (CO2) 
Absolue path	Relative path
Complete path from root directory to target	Path from current working directory to target
Always starts with/	Never starts with with/
Independent of current location	Depends on current working directory
Works from any directory	Only works from specific
/home/paul/documents/file.txt	Documents/file.txt or../ shared/data.txt

4. What command will give you the already executed command traces in the terminal. Give output snapshot. (CO1) 
History
cat ~/.bash_history      

5. Compare the working functionality of find and locate command. Which one is faster and why? (CO1)
A:find command:searches for files and directories in real time by scanning the directory tree.
Syntax:find /path-name filename
locate command:searches for files using a pre-built database
Syntax:locate filename
Therefore,locate is faster because it uses a pre-indexed database instead of scanning directories in real time.
find is more accurate and real-time,but comparatively slower.

 6. Which command is used to modify file permissions in Linux? Give an example. (CO1)
chmod command: The chmod command changes file permissions. Syntax: chmod [options] mode file
Example:Symbolic mode:
chmod u+x my_script.sh
chmod g-w my_file.txt
chmod 0=rwx my_dir/
Example:Octal node:
chmod 755 my_program
chmod 644 my_document

 7. A file has permissions -rw -r- -r- -. What does this mean? (CO1)
:    - = it is regular file
rw- = owner can have read and write permission
r-- = group can have only read permission
r-- = others can also have permission for only read 

 8. Explain the difference between chown and chgrp with an example. (CO1)
A: chown command: The chown command changes file ownership. Syntax: chown [options] owner:group file
Example:
1.Change the owner of a file
sudo chown alice file.txt
2.Change both owner and group
sudo chown bob:developers project.zip
3.Change recursively
sudo chown -R bob:bob 
chgrp command:changes the group only
Example:
1.Change group of a file
sudo chgrp staff report.doc
2.Change group recursively
sudo chgrp -R developers
3.Change with Is -I to check changes
Is -l file.txt

 9. A file needs to be accessible by multiple users but only writable by the owner. How will you set permissions? (CO1)
A:chmod 644 filename       -rw-r--r-- (644):
rw- owner can read and write
r- - group only read 
r- - others only read
Example:
$ ls -l myfile.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice users 120 Sep 27 10:30 myfile.txt
 
10. How do you check the manual page for any Linux commands? (CO1)
A:Syntax: man [command_name]
To view for ls command:
man ls
To view a man from a specific section:
man [section_number] [command_name]
